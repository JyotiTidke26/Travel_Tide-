# Travel_Tide Customer Segmentation Project

## Project Overview
The Travel_Tide Project aims to improve customer retention for an e-booking platform by analyzing user behavior and developing a personalized rewards program. The project leverages unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers into distinct personas, each with specific preferences and behaviors, allowing for more targeted marketing and engagement strategies. The ultimate goal is to enhance customer satisfaction, increase loyalty, and boost business performance.

## Motivation
The travel and hospitality industry faces increasing competition and customer churn, and personalization is key to retaining customers. This project was born out of the need to understand customer behavior more deeply and create strategies that cater to each segment. By using customer segmentation, we aim to provide Travel_Tide with actionable insights for better engagement and more effective marketing campaigns.

## Technologies Used

- Python for data analysis and modeling
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
- Jupyter Notebooks for development and documentation
- K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- Silhouette Score for evaluating clustering performance
  
## Data Collection & Cleaning
The analysis starts with data collection from multiple sources, focusing on user sessions and behavioral attributes. The data was cleaned by:

- Merging relevant tables at the session-level granularity
- Filtering data to include only those with at least 7 sessions post January 4, 2023
- Handling missing or inconsistent entries to ensure data integrity
## Methodology

We used K-Means clustering to segment Travel_Tide customers based on behavioral traits. The steps involved:

- Data Preprocessing: Standardizing customer features to ensure consistency in scaling.
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Reducing dimensionality for efficient clustering while maintaining essential variance.
- Clustering: Applying K-Means to group customers based on their behaviors and demographics.
- Silhouette Score: Evaluating clustering quality to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Customer Segmentation Analysis
  
We identified four distinct customer groups:

- Group 0: Family Travelers - Moderate travelers, typically female, with a preference for family-oriented perks.
- Group 1: Loyal Deal Seekers - Infrequent but loyal travelers, responsive to promotional offers and upgrades.
- Group 2: Smart Saver Travelers - Budget-conscious, regional travelers who prioritize discounts.
- Group 3: Luxury Travelers - High spenders with a preference for long-distance, premium experiences.

## Key Findings

- Family Travelers: Respond well to family-oriented perks, such as discounts for group bookings.
- Loyal Deal Seekers: Loyal to the platform, but book infrequently, appreciating complimentary upgrades.
- Smart Saver Travelers: Budget-conscious but regular, prefer short trips with significant discounts.
- Luxury Travelers: High-spenders who enjoy premium services for long-haul, international trips.
  
## Recommendations

- Optimize UX/UI: Improve booking experience for mid-tier users to increase conversions. Refine Segmentation Models: Continuously monitor and update models using real-time data.
- A/B Testing: Test various engagement strategies to determine the most effective approach for each segment Limitations & Challenges
Data Limitations: Some customer data was missing or inconsistent, requiring preprocessing to address gaps.
- Clustering Complexity: Identifying the optimal number of clusters was challenging, as customer behavior is complex and dynamic.
- Seasonality: Travel patterns may vary seasonally, which wasn't fully captured in this analysis.
